## 🚀 **Welcome to the Web’s Gnarliest Time Machine**  
Back when you had to “surf the web” and Yahoo! was a verb, one thing was missing:  
**90sTube.** Imagine if YouTube dropped straight out of a CRT monitor and smacked face-first into the golden era of denim jackets, slap bracelets, and overly enthusiastic Bob Saget commentary.  
In short: **this is AFV meets YouTube, but reimagined in the glorious, glitchy GIF-tastic style of 1998.**
